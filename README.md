# Welcome to the Runtime Components Creator!

The Runtime Components Create or RCC for short contains scripts that will create for example
a button while the game is running Some scripts aren't completly finished and the rcc is 
espacilly useful if you are editing a game in dnspy and want good
looking ui in game or you just do not want to use OnGUI

if you want to bake the navmesh at runtime use this
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents

## What isn't working
GUI_ScrollView.cs

GUI_DropDown_TMP.cs

## Important! Project is getting rewritten
So i want to put the scripts in a seperate dll because
it is supposed to kinda replace OnGUI
