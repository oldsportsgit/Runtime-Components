# Welcome to the Runtime Components Creator!

The Runtime Components Create or RCC for short contains scripts that will create for example
a button while the game is running Some scripts aren't completly finished tho i am working
on them and the rcc is espacilly useful if you are editing a game in dnspy and want good
looking ui in game if you do not want to use OnGUI
